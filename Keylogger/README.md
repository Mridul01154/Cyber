This is a basic Windows-based keylogger implemented in C, demonstrating how low-level keyboard input can be captured using the WinAPI. The program logs keystrokes, formats them with timestamps, and writes them to a disguised log file. It also hides its console window and attempts to persist by copying itself to the system's temp directory.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
Captures printable characters, control keys (e.g., Enter, Shift, Backspace)

Timestamps each logged keystroke

Detects and logs key combinations (e.g., Shift + letter, Caps Lock behavior)

Hides the console window on startup

Moves and relaunches itself from the %TEMP% directory as sysupdate.exe

Stores logs in a local file named system.log

Gracefully exits when the ESC key is pressed

üìÅ How It Works
The program hides the console using ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_HIDE).

It copies itself to the Windows Temp directory with a disguised name (sysupdate.exe).

It spawns a new thread to continuously listen for keypresses using GetAsyncKeyState.

Keystrokes are logged to a file named system.log with time-based formatting.
